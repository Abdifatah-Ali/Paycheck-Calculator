# Paycheck-Calculator
This is paycheck calculator app in an HTML webform using PHP. This app contains two-part form that calculates an employee's weekly gross salay, based on the number of hours worked and an hourly wage that you choose. In this project, I used an HTML document as a Web form with two text boxes-- one for the number of hours worked and one for the hourly wage. I also use a PHP document as the form handler. The app compute any hours over 40 as time and a half. To check the project, you should have Web server to run the code (I'm using WAMP server).
